Lecteur de Fichiers (Java Mini Project)

This mini-app reads and processes different file types from the local files/ directory, showcasing clean OOP in Java (interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism). It includes small text utilities like “palindromique” (reverse the letters of each word while preserving punctuation/spacing), line-wise inverse, and regular output.
